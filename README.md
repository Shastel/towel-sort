# Towel Sort

## Task
Your task is to implement the so-called 'towel sort' algorithm.

`towelSort` function should expect [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure#Multidimensional_arrays) of any shape for example:

```js
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ],
]
```

Following matrix should be 'sorted' to:
```
 [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9 ]
```


Write your code in `src/index.js.
*All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.*

## Prepare and test
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)   
2. Fork this repository: https://github.com/Shastel/towel-sort/
3. Clone your newly created repo: https://github.com/<%your_github_username%>/towel-sort/  
4. Go to folder `towel-sort`  
5. To install all dependencies use [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)  
6. Run `npm test` in the command line  
7. You will see the number of passing and failing tests you 100% of passing tests is equal to 100p in score  

## Submit to [rs app](https://app.rs.school)
1. Open [rs app](https://app.rs.school) and login
2. Go to [submit task page](https://app.rs.school/course/student/auto-test?course=rs-2020-q1)
3. Select your task (towel-sort)
4. Press the submit button and enjoy
### Notes
1. We recommend you to use nodejs of version 14 or lower. If you using are any of the features which are not supported by v12, the score won't be submitted.
2. Each of your test case is limited to 30 sec.
